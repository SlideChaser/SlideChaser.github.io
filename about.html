                <p>
                    Growing up in the mountains and in the country, I was building computers and working with B.A.S.I.C. when I was
                    twelve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started getting interested in more low level languages, and of course ended up looking into C and C++.
                    This proved pretty intimidating to my young self, and I quickly got overwhelmed. My parents tried to help me move
                    forward with it and my grandma, on my moms side, even got me a nice MacBook that I was supposed to learn more about
                    computer with. It just didn't really happen at the time. But during 2020 I was inspired by an idea I had hanging out
                    with my neighbor watching him play some video games. Long story short I decided I needed to get back into programming
                    if I wanted to have any chance of pushing my idea forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started taking C++ for unreal on Udemy, and then
                    just C++ and then C, and when I was still frustrated that nobody was explaining the "How's" and "Why's" I decided
                    to take Assembly as well. This has helped me understand the principles and inner workings of a computer so much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the local company BitWise started offering virtual courses (You know cause COVID and all) I immediately
                    signed up. It wasn't the low level stuff I wanted to learn, but I pride myself in being multifaceted and what harm
                    could it do to learn more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I am so glad that I did, I'm typing this out in VS Code now and I am so excited
                    about how much fun web design can be. Albeit html has it's own set of frustrations that have proved entirely
                    different from C and BASIC. But nonetheless, I have discovered a new way to apply my creativity and it is just too much
                    fun!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay tuned ;P
                </p>
